# DefenseOfRazbia
A reverse tower defense game [still under development]

Discord [ https://discord.gg/7D6xdHY ]

Concept behind Defense of Razbia is that its a tower defense , but instead of damaging units , you heal units and not only that,
  you should also be able to buff em and change their AI depending on upgrades.

The game is written all in python.

Currently the code will just show a map full of base_tiles and incorrectly unit_tiles . I've added this to github for the version control feature

To hear more about the game and its updated or contact me for stuff like joining the project , go on the discord server
